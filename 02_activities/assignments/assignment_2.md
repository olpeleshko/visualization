# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.

#### Good visualization - Homelessness in Australia by Kimly Scott (https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/kimly.scott/viz/WorldHomelessnessDayHomelessnessinAustralia/HomelessnessinAustralia)

- Why classified good?
```
The diagram creates empathy as each individual person represents an actual homeless person as opposed to showing dry anonynymous statistics about homeless in Australia, and demonstrates how big of a number 122,494 actually. These visualizations were created for the purpose of persuading general public and make it more aware of the problem, especially when it comes to voting. Each visual goes in-depth into some of the aspects of homeless, some of them not as obvious as others, e.g. that children between 0-12 and 12-18 represent a significant chunk of homelessness population. The visuals are carefully thought through from design perspective, e.g. the choice of pink as the primary colour creates empathy for the individuals experiencing problem (as opposed to choosing gray or blue colour). Trends are visualized via bar charts, proportions are visualized via pie charts, making it easy to interpret this information. Despite the graphs containing lots of information (i.e. intrinsic cognitive load being high), extraneous cognitive load is actually low because of all of these choices.
```
- How could this data visualization have been improved?  
```
1. It was not obvious in the beginning why the diagram had different shades of pink (i.e. what the shades represent). Those shades were most likely added to differentiate between circles, i.e. not make them appear as a single monotone block. However, it goes against Similarity Gestalt principle ("similar objects are grouped, regardless of proximity", but there is no meaningful grouping), and it would be better to state this in the legend.
2. Conclusion for #9 (Females accessing SHS support is growing) is not obvious from the corresponding diagrams. E.g. for the second diagram in that section, it appears as if the number of females accessing SHS has actually been dropping since 2017. Either the diagram should be added or more context added to draw the right conclusion from this diagram.
3. Overall, the diagram feels somewhat slow, it takes a while to toggle between different options

#### Bad visualization - PACIFIC RESILIENCE by Seun Adeyemo (https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/bigxpt/viz/PACIFICRESILIENCE/story)
- Why classified bad?
```
The cognitive load (specifically extraneous cognitive load) for this diagram is very high due to various visual elements that, on one hand, add to the Pacific Island theme, but, not on the other hand, add many distractions. E.g. for the first page, it was not clear what gray lines represent (they just point to Island labels). Also, intuitively, taller trees should mean less vulnerability, but it's the opposite in this diagram. Additionally, brown vs. green colour coding is not intuitive - it's strange to see Solomon Islands (~ 150K people impacted), Fiji (~ 85K people impacted ), and Papua New Guinea (~ 394K people impacted) all having green labels. For the second page, extra pictures that are obvious (e.g. Earth warming up, Sun melting glacier) also add to cognitive load while not adding any meaning. Similarly, islands on the right intuitively appear more vulnerable (since they are more submerged), but it's actually the opposite. For the third page, the ordering of islands appears random, e.g. PG appears the 1st one for 2005-2010, but the 9th for 2011-2016. For the fourth page, it appears as if the islands are split into two groups (Fight vs. Flight, Enclosure Gestalt principle) but there is actually no split. Last page presents too much information - it lists several principles to combat climate change on the Pacific Islands, practical steps to take, climate budgeting concerns, map of the islands, data sources, and the option to toggle to the graph showing % using DDR strategies. Last, but not least, most of these 5 graphs use 3D, which causes confusion at first as it creates a false impression that islands in the middle are more protected than on the edges.
```
- How could this data visualization have been improved?  
```
1. Reverse direction of the trees to show islands with longer trees are more vulnerable to water levels
2. Use color coding based on the subgraph option (e.g. Solomon Islands, Fiji, and PNG should appear brown when user toggles to % of population option on the first graph)
3. Remove extra visuals that are obvious / do not add value (e.g. for the second page)
4. Use consistent ordering of islands (e.g. for the third page)
5. Do not add a vertical line between FLIGHT vs. FIGHT pagraphs for the fourth page
6. Split up the fifth page into two or more pages
7. Remove 3d and stick to simpler bar charts
```

- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)
